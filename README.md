## Easy Broker_API exercise
### Hello dev🧑🏻‍💻

This is my attempt on **EasyBroker** exercise

I will use **Bundler** to install the Ruby gems

- Use `bundle install`command to use the exact version of the gems find in the Gemfile, for this I will use ***dotenv*** to keep my token and sensitive data protected, ***rspec*** for TDD and ***rest-client*** for HTTP requests.
- Test can be run with the `bundle exec rspec`
